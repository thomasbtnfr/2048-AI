# IA Project S8 INSA - 2048

Implementation of the 2048 game logic and different AI algorithms in Python.

Our goal was to implement several algorithms and to compare them.

## Algorithms :

1. ### Minmax

   The minmax algorithm is used for games between opponents. To implement it, we consider two players: max and min. Max must maximize the score and corresponds to the player. He performs at each turn one of the 4 possible actions. Min corresponds to the computer that places a 2 or 4 on the grid each turn. It is not really an opponent, because it plays randomly but for this algorithm we considered it as an opponent and the results are interisting.
